  "Checklist": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md provide complete specification of the methodology: OV matrix construction from top-k heads, hidden state extraction at specified layers, and nearest-neighbor parallelogram evaluation. No major inference or guesswork required for reimplementation.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "Environment is reproducible with standard dependencies (nnsight, torch, transformers). Model (Llama-2-7b-hf) is publicly available. All data files and pre-computed head orderings are included in the repository. No version conflicts encountered.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Experiment is deterministic with model inference under torch.no_grad(). Verified test case (concept lens, layer 20, capital-common-countries) produced exact match: 0.8953. No random sampling or stochastic components in the methodology."
