  "Rationale": {
    "GT1_ModelGeneralization": "The OV projection method successfully predicted 1 out of 3 analogies on Meta-Llama-3-8B (a model not used in the original work). Specifically, the token-head projection correctly predicted 'dancing - danced + ran = running' for a grammatical task, while the raw hidden states failed. This demonstrates that the concept of using attention head OV matrices for analogy completion transfers to different model architectures (Llama-3 vs Llama-2).",
    "GT2_DataGeneralization": "The OV projection method successfully predicted 1 out of 3 analogies on NEW data instances not in the original dataset. Specifically, 'climbing - climbed + painted = painting' was correctly predicted using token-head projection on the original Llama-2-7b model with verbs that do not appear in the original gram7-past-tense dataset. The raw hidden states failed on this example. This demonstrates the finding generalizes to unseen examples.",
    "GT3_MethodGeneralization": "The OV lens projection method failed on all 3 new task types tested (synonym analogy, antonym analogy, and person-occupation analogy). None of the projected vectors correctly predicted the target word. The method appears specialized to the specific task categories (capital-country semantic relations and grammatical transformations like verb tense) studied in the original work, and does not generalize well to other semantic relationship types like synonymy, antonymy, or person-occupation mappings."
