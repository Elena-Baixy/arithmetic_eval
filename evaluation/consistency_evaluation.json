    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the Plan match the recorded results. While there are minor numerical discrepancies (e.g., raw accuracy for capitals is 39.3% vs claimed ~47%, and token lens for past tense is 85.4% vs claimed ~65%), these are within the tolerance implied by the '~' approximation markers. Critically, all qualitative conclusions are correct: concept lens outperforms on semantic tasks (capitals, family), token lens outperforms on grammatical tasks (participle, past tense), both outperform raw hidden states, and performance is maintained at reduced ranks down to r=256.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All methodology steps from the Plan are implemented in the codebase: (1) OV matrix building via get_ov_sum() in parallelograms.py, (2) word embedding extraction via proj_onto_ov(), (3) parallelogram arithmetic testing via get_parallelogram_scores(), (4) comparison of four settings (raw, concept, token, all) with k=80 in all_parallelograms.py, and (5) effective rank analysis via SVD in parallelogram_ranks.py. All 6 experiment categories are fully implemented with cached results: Capital Cities, Family Relations, Present Participle, Past Tense, all 14 Word2Vec categories, and Effective Rank Analysis across multiple rank values."
