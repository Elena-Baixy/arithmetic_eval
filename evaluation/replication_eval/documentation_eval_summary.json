  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "All reported accuracy values match original cached results within 0.1% tolerance. Capital Cities (concept lens, layer 20): 89.5% replicated vs 89.53% original (0.03% diff). Family: 6.9% vs 6.92% (0.02% diff). Present Participle (token lens, layer 16): 54.2% vs 54.17% (0.03% diff). Past Tense: 56.4% vs 56.41% (0.01% diff).",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "Replicated conclusions are fully consistent with original: (1) Concept lens improves semantic tasks like capital-country analogies, (2) Token lens improves grammatical/wordform tasks, (3) Both lenses outperform raw hidden states. Layer-specific observations in replication derive directly from experimental results and support original claims.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "All claims in replicated documentation are traceable to original sources: methodology from documentation.pdf (Dual-Route Model), experimental setup from CodeWalkthrough.md (word2vec evaluation), and numerical results from cached parallelogram results. No external references, invented findings, or hallucinated details detected."
